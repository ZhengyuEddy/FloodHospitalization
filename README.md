# How floods have a long-term impact on health
Flood events impact health through the contamination of water supply system, which can elevate the risk of digestive diseases and aid the spread of infectious diseases. Additionally, floods can create environments that are conducive to the growth of fungi, bacteria, viruses, and vectors like mice and insects which can trigger outbreaks of respiratory, digestive, and infectious diseases. Floods may also force massive evacuations, causing displacement. Even when temporary shelters are provided, short in sanitation facilities often result in hygiene issues, raising the likelihood of respiratory, digestive, and infectious diseases. Access and capacity to healthcare services may be impaired after floods, leading to delay in regular medical interventions, which include dialysis for renal diseases, chemotherapy and radiotherapy for cancer, and medication regimens for cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, digestive diseases, mental disorders, diabetes, nervous system disorders, and renal diseases. And long-term psychological stress (e.g., from property damage and financial losses) can worsen or induce adverse health outcomes by compromising the immune system, disrupting sleep, leading to substance abuse, and diminishing self-care.
